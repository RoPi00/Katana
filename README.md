e.g : com for Usa / co.ma for Morocoo / be for Belgium

## Scada Mode :
Scada mode search in google for online PLCs this actually use multiple requests so your ip will be blocked by Google
so changing the TLD will solve the probleme and the script provides inputs for that.

Tor mode gives you 1 input wich is the search query but before you should have tor proxy running on port 9050 
this time there is no ip blocking the script search in 3 tor search engines Phobos, Tor66 and Tordex (more will be added)

## What if :
- The script print 'Error too many requests'           : change the TLD
- Changing the TLD don't work                          : change your ip by disconnecting and reconnecting again
- Tor mode show 'Failed to establish a new connection' : make sure that tor proxy up and running on port 9050

## Proxy Mode :
Proxy mode find proxy servers and print them it will print 25 Different Proxy server Each time
